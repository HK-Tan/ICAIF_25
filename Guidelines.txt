1. Web scrape ticker names to have a broader database.

2. Analyze the composition of clusters provided by each algorithm, meaning to create a function that gives the 
composition of each cluster with the tickers.
-> For example, if we have 3 stocks 'AAPL'/'MSFT'/'ADBE' and the label vector is [0, 1, 0], create a function that 
takes the data and the label vector as input and returns 2 clusters in the form of ['AAPL', 'ADBE'] and ['MSFT'].

3. Create a function that returns the return for each cluster (assuming we have the weights) â€” we won't worry about 
how to calculate the weights for now. We assume the function takes a vector that provides the weights for each asset 
within a cluster as an argument.

4. Create a function that calculates the covariance matrix of K fictional assets (1 asset = 1 cluster) based on their 
returns, which we calculated in 3/.

5. Perform Markowitz optimization on the covariance matrices, calculate the PnL (Profit and Loss) and Sharpe Ratio 
for 100 micro-portfolios, and rank them.

6. Test this procedure with K-Means, EM (Expectation-Maximization), Gaussian Mixture, and SSBM (Stochastic Block Model).
