### **Portfolio Construction and Realized Covariance Forecasting with Clustering**

Welcome to our research project repository! This work is a collaborative effort by three ENSAE students: Jerome Allier, Nail Khelifa, and Mohammed Keteb. We are privileged to be supervised by Prof. Mihai Cucuringu from Oxford University.

## **Overview**
The central theme of our research revolves around the application of clustering in the construction of portfolios and forecasting realized covariance. We aim to provide insights into how clustering can enhance traditional portfolio construction methods and potentially provide a more optimal risk-return tradeoff.

## **Repository Structure**

1.**module1**: This module contains all the foundational functions used for portfolio construction leveraging clustering techniques.

2.**Draft 1**: This is a comprehensive walkthrough detailing the step-by-step process of constructing a portfolio using the functions from module1. The empirical experiments in this draft make use of data fetched from Yahoo Finance, and the focus is predominantly on stocks from the S&P 500 index.

3.**Get S&P 500**: A utility file crafted to scrape and retrieve all the ticker symbols associated with the S&P 500 index from Wikipedia. Useful for anyone looking to fetch a fresh list of constituents of the S&P 500.

## **Getting Started**

1.**Prerequisites**: Ensure you have the required libraries and dependencies installed. (You can list them out or provide a requirements.txt).

2.**Data Source**: We utilize financial data from Yahoo Finance. Ensure you have an active internet connection if you're looking to replicate or extend our results.

Navigate to Draft 1 to see a hands-on demonstration of portfolio construction using our methodologies.

## **Future Enhancements**

Stay tuned as we continue to refine our methodologies and possibly expand our horizons to other financial markets or clustering techniques.
